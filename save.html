        <h5>HTML: HyperText Markup Language</h5>
        Html <mark> (HyperText Markup Language)</mark> is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the
        meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web
        page's appearance/presentation ( <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS" target="_blank">Css</a> ) or
        functionality/behavior (<a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript"
          target="_blank"> JavaScript</a> )

        <u>"Hypertext"</u> refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or
        between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it
        to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

        <h5>Prerequisites </h5>
        <p>
          before starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at least basic
          familiarity with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it and consuming content).
          You should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed in <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Installing_basic_software"
            target="_blank">Installing basic software</a>)
          and understand how to create and manage files (as detailed in <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files" target="_blank">

      <h5>Getting started with the web</h5>
      <p>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS">CSS</a> <mark>(Cascading Style Sheets)</mark>
        allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what
        CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.

      <h5>The story of your first website</h5>

      <p>
        It's a lot of work to create a professional website, so if you're new to web development, we encourage you to
        start small. You won't build another Facebook right away, but it's not hard to make your own simple website
        online, so we'll start there.
      </p>

      <h5>
        Guides
      </h5>
      <p>By working through the articles listed below, you will go from nothing to getting your first webpage online.
        Let's begin our journey!</p>
        <p>
          In the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML" target="_blank-">Introduction to HTML</a> module, we covered what HTML is and how it is used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing are the browser's default styles — very basic styles — that the browser applies to HTML to make sure that the page will be basically readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.

          Welcome ✋✋, in this article we will look at JavaScript from a high level, answering questions such as "What is it?" and "What can you do with it?", and making sure you are comfortable with JavaScript's purpose.
        </p>
      <p> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> is a <mark>scripting language</mark>  that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</p>
